# Deep RL Networks
As a part of my undergraduate research, I have been tasked with learning deep reinforcement learning.
These are my implementations of common reinforcement learning algorithms using Pytorch and Gymnasium.
Feel free to use the code as a reference. My skill in pytorch increased by a lot with every algorithm, so the older the file, the more likely you are to find bad practices.
